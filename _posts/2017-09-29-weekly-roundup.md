<h3 class="category">DATA PRIVACY</h3>

<div class="item">
  <h3 class="item-header">
    <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-isnt-collecting-user-data-safari-its-collecting-crappy-website-trends">Apple isn't collecting user data in Safari, it's collecting crappy website trends</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    "Apple is using differential privacy in macOS High Sierra to figure out how best to tackle web sites that use excessive power, memory, or crash the browser tab. Basically, looking for more trends it can address, like it's already doing by actively blocking third party trackers."

<h3 class="category">DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<div class="item">
  <h3 class="item-header">
    <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/21/facebook_apache_openbsd_plus_license_dispute/">Facebook won't change React.js license despite Apache developer pain</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    "Facebook's decided to stick with its preferred version of the BSD license despite the Apache Foundation sin-binning it for any future projects. The Foundation barred use of Facebook's BSD-plus-Patents license in July, placing it in the “Category X” it reserves for “disallowed licenses”."

    <a href="https://www.imore.com/macos-high-sierra">macOS High Sierra review: A radical new foundation for your Mac</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    "macOS High Sierra promises advanced technologies and refinements, but are a new file system, more efficient video and photo handling, better graphics and virtual reality, machine learning made easier, and more private Safari enough?"

<div class="item">

    <a href="https://www.imore.com/ios-11">iOS 11 review: Smarter, better, faster, bolder</a>
  </h3>
  <p>

  </h3>
  <p>
    "Today Facebook’s Workplace takes a giant step forward with the addition of a pretty high-profile customer: Walmart. The addition of the largest private employer in the world is a huge coup for Workplace, which launched less than a year ago. It’s also a big move for Walmart. Employees from the company’s corporate office to the store level will be using Facebook going forward to collaborate on projects and communicate with other associates."

  </h3>
  <p>
    "Amazon surprised everyone with a press event that unveiled a bunch of new Echo hardware.

Today’s event also introduced a refreshed Fire TV, just days after Apple launched its updated Apple TV with 4K support."
