I attended [GR8Conf Europe](http://gr8conf.eu/) in Copenhagen back in June, the conference is dedicated to Groovy, Grails and the related technologies. They have published videos of many of the talks over that last month on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJXNOMywewNmau4hzAy4LjA). Of the talks I attended these three stick in my mind:

### Hybrid client/server view rendering with Grails
