  </h3>
  <p>
    "Microsoft, Facebook, and the telecoms infrastructure company Telxius have announced the completion of the highest capacity subsea cable to ever cross the Atlantic Ocean. The cable is capable of transmitting 160 terabits of data per second, the equivalent of streaming 71 million HD videos at the same time, and 16 million times faster than an average home internet connection, Microsoft claims. The cable will be operational by early 2018."

  <p>
    "Apple has always shared the kernel of macOS after each major release. This kernel also runs on iOS devices as both macOS and iOS are built on the same foundation. This year, Apple also shared the most recent version of the kernel on GitHub. And you can also find ARM versions of the kernel for the first time."

  </h3>
  <p>
    "Next week, we are going to relicense our open source projects React, Jest, Flow, and Immutable.js under the MIT license. We're relicensing these projects because React is the foundation of a broad ecosystem of open source software for the web, and we don't want to hold back forward progress for nontechnical reasons."

  </h3>
  <p>
    "GOOGLE HAS BIG dreams for the future. “In an AI first world, computers should adapt to help people live their lives,” said CEO Sundar Pichai at the company’s big hardware event today. No one wants to think about the technology that lets them move from screen to screen, or which phrases Google Assistant can or can’t understand. People just want it to work. That’s the big theme that extends across everything Google announced today, from the brains behind its new generation of Pixel phones to the newly miniaturized and maximized Google Home devices. With a smart combination of hardware, software, and artificial intelligence, it all just works."
