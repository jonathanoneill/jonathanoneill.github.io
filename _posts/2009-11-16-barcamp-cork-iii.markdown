Barcamp was at the Cork International Airport Hotel on Saturday. It was a great event with lots of interesting talks and informal discussion. Congratulations on the organisation to <a href="http://www.findaconferencevenue.com/">Ciara Feely</a>, <a href="http://www.murrion.ie/murmurs/">Gordon Murray</a> and <a href="http://www.weddingdates.ie/">Ciara Crossan</a> and all those who gave talks on the day. Here are a few  short notes on the talks I attended.

* <strong>Erlang for Five Nines</strong> (<a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/tamas-nagy/8/766/722">Tamas Nagy</a>) - <a href="http://www.erlang.org">Erlang</a> is a general-purpose concurrent programming language and runtime originally designed by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant applications. It was released as open source in 1998 but is getting more mainstream attention as <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb">Amazon SimpleDB </a>are written with it.

* <strong>Marketing Strategies for Start-ups and Entrepreneurs</strong> (<a href="http://ie.linkedin.com/in/outsourcedmarketingsolutions">Una Coleman</a>) - Social media tools i.e. Blog, Twitter, Linkedin etc.

* <strong>Open Street Map</strong> (<a href="http://ie.linkedin.com/in/conoroneill">Conor O’Neill</a>) - <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreeyMap</a> is Wikipedia for maps. Conor demonstrated how data can be gathered with a GPS enabled phone and uploaded to the OpenStreetMap.

* <strong>How (and why) KildareStreet is porting a million-row-DB app to Django without changing the existing DB *at all* </strong>(<a href="http://ie.linkedin.com/in/johnhandelaar">John Handelaar</a>) - <a href="http://kildarestreet.com">KildareStreet.com </a>aims to make it easy for people to keep tabs on their elected representatives in the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is based on the code for <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com </a> which keeps track of the UK's parliaments and assemblies and has been modified to handle Irish data.

* <strong>Seeing an iPhone application idea through to the Apple app store</strong> (<a href="http://ie.linkedin.com/in/triplespin">Mike Butler</a>) - <a href="http://apps.ie">Apps.ie</a> is a site to showcase iPhone and mobile apps developed in Ireland or with an Irish context. <a href="http://x-cake.ning.com/">Xcake</a> is the Irish and Northern Irish mobile developers group.

* <strong>The Creation, Protection and Exploitation of Software - A Practical Approach</strong> (<a href="http://ie.linkedin.com/pub/david-reilly/4/871/798">David Reilly</a>) - Consider IP ownership including brand names up front rather than having problems later.

* <strong>Multi Touch User Interfaces</strong> (<a href="http://ie.linkedin.com/in/martharotter">Martha Rotter</a>)  - Multi Touch allows applications to have some great interactive features but the hardware will need to get more widely available, see the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/martharotter/building-multitouch-experiences">Slides</a> from the presentation.
