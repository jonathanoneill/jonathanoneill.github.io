Developing applications on platforms like Facebook and iOS allows third party developers to leverage the existing features of the platform to easily delivery their applications and give users a familiar experience. While these are great benefits it is also worth considering the potential risks for the continued function of your application and your business model if the platform provider decides to make changes. There is a good summary of this risks in Zynga's recent pre IPO <a title="Zynga Inc SEC Form S-1" href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1439404/000119312511180285/ds1.htm" target="_blank">SEC filings</a>.

<blockquote><p><strong><em>If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with Facebook, our business will suffer.</em></strong></p>
<p>Facebook is the primary distribution, marketing, promotion and payment platform for our games. We generate substantially all of our revenue and players through the Facebook platform and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Any deterioration in our relationship with Facebook would harm our business and adversely affect the value of our Class A common stock.</p>
<p>We are subject to Facebook’s standard terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of games and other applications on the Facebook platform. We have entered into an addendum to these terms and conditions pursuant to which we have agreed to use Facebook Credits, Facebook’s proprietary payment method, as the primary means of payment within our games played through Facebook. This addendum expires in May 2015.</p>
<p>Our business would be harmed if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook discontinues or limits access to its platform by us and other game developers;</li>
<li>Facebook terminates or does not renew our addendum;</li>
<li>Facebook modifies its terms of service or other policies, including fees charged to, or other restrictions on, us or other application developers, or Facebook changes how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the Facebook platform or shared by users;</li>
<li>Facebook establishes more favorable relationships with one or more of our competitors; or</li>
<li>Facebook develops its own competitive offerings.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have benefited from Facebook’s strong brand recognition and large user base. If Facebook loses its market position or otherwise falls out of favor with Internet users, we would need to identify alternative channels for marketing, promoting and distributing our games, which would consume substantial resources and may not be effective. In addition, Facebook has broad discretion to change its terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers, and those changes may be unfavorable to us. For example, in 2010 Facebook adopted a policy requiring applications on Facebook accept only its virtual currency, Facebook Credits, as payment from users. As a result of this change, which we completed in April 2011, Facebook receives a greater share of payments made by our players than it did when other payment options were allowed. Facebook may also change its fee structure, add fees associated with access to and use of the Facebook platform, change how the personal information of its users is made available to application developers on the Facebook platform or restrict how Facebook users can share information with friends on their platform. Beginning in early 2010, Facebook changed its policies for application developers regarding use of its communication channels. These changes limited the level of communication among users about applications on the Facebook platform. As a result, the number of our players on Facebook declined. Any such changes in the future could significantly alter how players experience our games or interact within our games, which may harm our business.</p></blockquote>
