Ireland's first startup weekend held at the <a title="NDRC" href="http://ndrc.ie">NDRC</a> in Dublin, May 7th - 9th. Startup weekend is a great concept where you get 50-100 people in a room over a weekend to "builds communities, companies and projects". It was a great experience to participate and I met some excellent people and learned allot. Rather than writing another lengthy account anyone interested should read Sean Murphys post on <a title="First Dublin Startup Weekend a great  success" href="http://www.web2ireland.org/2010/05/12/first-dublin-startup-weekend-a-great-success">web2ireland</a> for a full account.</p>
