	</h3>
	<p>
		Interesting post on the statistics around ebook sales. I don't think this post fully clarifies the situation but it does highlight that the reported figures are only including  traditional publishers which misses a large percentage of the full market.

	<p>
		Sky has launched Now TV in Ireland, it has been available in the UK since 2012. Its television, film and live sport streaming service, on the Irish market, is a further move towards on-demand viewing in Ireland. I also see that in 2018, Sky will also offer Sky Q in the UK without the need for a satellite dish.
