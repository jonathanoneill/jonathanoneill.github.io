### DATA SCIENCE

### MEDIA

[No, CNN, eBook Sales Have Not Plunged Nearly 20%](http://the-digital-reader.com/2017/05/01/no-cnn-ebook-sales-not-plunged-nearly-20/)

Interesting post on the statistics around ebook sales. I don't think this post fully clarifies the situation but it does highlight that the reported figures are only including  traditional publishers which misses a large percentage of the full market.

[Sky brings Now TV on-demand service to Ireland](http://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/sky-brings-now-tv-on-demand-service-to-ireland-1.3061851)

Sky has launched Now TV in Ireland, it has been available in the UK since 2012. Its television, film and live sport streaming service, on the Irish market, is a further move towards on-demand viewing in Ireland. I also see that in 2018, Sky will also offer Sky Q in the UK without the need for a satellite dish.
