<a title="Google Apps" href="http://www.google.com/apps/" target="_blank">Google Apps</a> has been around for some time but I have only recently used it to set-up email from a domain i.e. *user@mydomain.com*. It is straight forward to configure and you get allot for free using <a title="Google Apps Standard Edition" href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html" target="_blank">Standard Edition</a> with up to 50 users with 7GB per user of email storage.

There are only two step required:

* Register for Google Apps Standard Edition
* Change your domains DNS MX record to point to the Google mail servers

How you change the MX record will depend on how your domain is managed but there are good <a title=" Setting up email delivery" href="http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=33352" target="_blank">instructions</a> on this for the uninitiated.

For $50 per user per year you can upgrade  to the Premium Edition  which adds additional storage,  phone and email support and an  SLA. There is also information available on how to migrating from <a title="Switch from Microsoft Exchange to Google Apps" href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/switch_exchange.html" target="_blank">Microsoft Exchange</a>.
