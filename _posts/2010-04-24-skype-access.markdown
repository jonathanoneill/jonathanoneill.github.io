The  new <a title="Skype Access" href="http://skype.com/go/skypeaccess">Skype Access</a> service provides a very convenient way to access public  WiFi hotspots in hotels, airports and other public locations. While  there are many places that offer free WiFi and many of us use some sort  of mobile broadband there are always times especially when traveling  that you are confronted by a screen where you have to "sign up for...",  "enter code...", "pay with credit card" etc.

Skype Access allows you to pay for access to these hotspots via Skype Credit which if you  are an existing Skype user you will already have for making calls to  fixed line or mobile numbers. There is no additional sign up required  for the local providers.

When you connect a Skype Access box pops telling you that the hotspot  supports Skype Access:

It then displays the cost and asks if you want to connect:

An information screen (or tool bar item) shows how long you have been  connected and the cost of the session when connected:

Skype Access  was introduced in Skype 4.2 for Windows (April 8, 2010) and Skype 2.8  for Mac OS X (February 10, 2010).

Skype claim the service is available  at "100,000 WiFi hotspots worldwide" and a <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10372/Which-SSID-should-I-use-to-connect-with-Skype-Access">list of supported WiFi providers</a> and <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10010/How-much-does-Skype-Access-cost">rates</a> are available from Skype. I have tried this with <a title="eircom" href="http://eircom.ie">eircom</a> and <a title="BT Openzone" href="http://btopenzone.com">BT Openzone</a> and it works  well.
