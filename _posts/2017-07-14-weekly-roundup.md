  </h3>
  <p>
  	Gradient Ventures, a new firm within Google will invest in early-stage artificial intelligence startups. Alphabet already has GV (formerly Google Ventures), which backs startups at all stages, and CapitalG (formerly Google Capital), which invests in later-stage companies. "Gradient portfolio companies will have the opportunity to receive advanced AI training from Google. They can also have a Google engineer work onsite and provide assistance as needed for a set period of time". "Another perk is that portfolio companies will be able to access vast swaths of training data that Google has accumulated to train their own AI systems."

  </h3>
  <p>
  	This is an interesting story, it is about payment for music and distribution of the money to all the participants (not distribution of the music itself, as the headline may have you believe). "A blockchain-empowered rights and payments layer could provide the means to do so."
